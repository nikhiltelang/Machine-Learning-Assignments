    "Ans:Human learning is a process of acquiring knowledge. Our behavior, skills, values and ethics are acquired when we process information through our minds and learn. Human learning may occur as part of education, personal development or any other informal/formal training. Children learn while they play, experiment, and interact. However, the process of learning is a continuous process. We constantly learn, unlearn and relearn through our experiences. To express ideas, to inform people, to communicate, to create etc we need to learn.Learning is “a process that leads to change, \n",
    "which occurs as a result of experience and increases the potential for improved performance and future learning”\n"
