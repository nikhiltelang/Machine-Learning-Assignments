    "Quantitative data : \n",
    "Quantitative data refers to any information that can be quantified. If it can be counted or measured, and given a numerical value, it’s quantitative data. Quantitative data can tell you “how many,” “how much,” or “how often”—for example, how many people attended last week’s webinar? \n",
    "How much revenue did the company make in 2019? How often does a certain customer group use online banking?\n",
    "\n",
    "qualitative data:\n",
    "Unlike quantitative data, qualitative data cannot be measured or counted. It’s descriptive, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers will often turn to qualitative data to answer “Why?” or “How?” questions. For example, if your quantitative data tells you that a certain website visitor abandoned their shopping cart three times in one week, you’d probably want to investigate why—and this might involve collecting some form of qualitative data from the user. Perhaps you want to know how a user feels about a particular product; again, qualitative data can provide such insights. In this case, you’re not just looking at numbers; you’re asking the user to tell you, using language, why they did something or how they feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative data also refers to the words or labels used to describe certain characteristics or traits—for example, describing the sky as blue or labeling a particular ice cream flavor as vanilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between quantitative and qualitative data lie in what they tell us, how they are collected, and how they are analyzed. Let’s summarize the key differences before exploring each aspect in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data is countable or measurable, relating to numbers. Qualitative data is descriptive, relating to language.\n",
    "Quantitative data tells us how many, how much, or how often (e.g. “20 people signed up to our email newsletter last week”). Qualitative data can help us to understand the “why” or “how” behind certain behaviors, or it can simply describe a certain attribute—for example, “The postbox is red” or “I signed up to the email newsletter because I’m really interested in hearing about local events.”\n",
    "Quantitative data is fixed and “universal,” while qualitative data is subjective and dynamic. For example, if something weighs 20 kilograms, that can be considered an objective fact. However, two people may have very different qualitative accounts of how they experience a particular event.\n",
    "Quantitative data is gathered by measuring and counting. Qualitative data is collected by interviewing and observing.\n",
    "Quantitative data is analyzed using statistical analysis, while qualitative data is analyzed by grouping it in terms of meaningful categories or themes."

It requires no inference, and the true value can be assessed. But it can be time-consuming or might require specific coding.\n",

In our example dataset, ‘Triceps skinfold thickness’ is one of the variables that have some missing values. All the missing values in this variable will be replaced by the value 29.12 which is the mean of all the values that are available to us. The same method can be applied to other variables as well."

    "Ans: Types of Missing Data\n",
    "Understanding the nature of missing data is critical in determining what treatments can be applied to overcome the lack of data. Data can be missing in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Completely At Random (MCAR): When missing values are randomly distributed across all observations, then we consider the data to be missing completely at random. A quick check for this is to compare two parts of data – one with missing observations and the other without missing observations. On a t-test, if we do not find any difference in means between the two samples of data, we can assume the data to be MCAR.\n",
    "Missing At Random (MAR): The key difference between MCAR and MAR is that under MAR the data is not missing randomly across all observations, but is missing randomly only within sub-samples of data. For example, if high school GPA data is missing randomly across all schools in a district, that data will be considered MCAR. However, if data is randomly missing for students in specific schools of the district, then the data is MAR.\n",
    "Not Missing At Random (NMAR): When the missing data has a structure to it, we cannot treat it as missing at random. In the above example, if the data was missing for all students from specific schools, then the data cannot be treated as MAR.\n",
    "Common Methods\n",
    "1. Mean or Median Imputation\n",
    "When data is missing at random, we can use list-wise or pair-wise deletion of the missing observations. However, there can be multiple reasons why this may not be the most feasible option:\n",
    "\n",
    "There may not be enough observations with non-missing data to produce a reliable analysis\n",
    "In predictive analytics, missing data can prevent the predictions for those observations which have missing data\n",
    "External factors may require specific observations to be part of the analysis\n",
    "In such cases, we impute values for missing data. A common technique is to use the mean or median of the non-missing observations. This can be useful in cases where the number of missing observations is low. However, for large number of missing values, using mean or median can result in loss of variation in data and it is better to use imputations. Depending upon the nature of the missing data, we use different techniques to impute data that have been described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)\n",
    "MICE assumes that the missing data are Missing at Random (MAR). It imputes data on a variable-by-variable basis by specifying an imputation model per variable. MICE uses predictive mean matching (PMM) for continuous variables, logistic regressions for binary variables, bayesian polytomous regressions for factor variables, and proportional odds model for ordered variables to impute missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the data for MICE, it is important to note that the algorithm uses all the variables in the data for predictions. In this case, variables that may not be useful for predictions, like the ID variable, should be removed before implementing this algorithm."
